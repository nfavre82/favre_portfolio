                <h3>Bachelor of Computer Science: First impressions</h3>    
                <p>Last month, I started studying with the <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/">University of the People</a> for a fully-online <strong><a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/online-bachelors/computer-science/">Bachelor of Computer Science</a></strong>. I'm currently enrolled in the very first course, which deals with online learning strategies. Still no real computer science or Web development related course in sight. So far I rather enjoy this first class, but I still want to make more progress through the Bachelor curriculum, before giving a more in-depth review about this online Bachelor.</p>
                <p>I really enjoy the first course I'm currently studying for, though I wish I could still meet up with the instructor and other students. I miss the interactions to be found in a more "traditional" university. On the other hand, I like the flexibility that this online university gives me. I can select between 1 and 3 courses for each term, and progress through the curriculum as fast or slow as I want and/or need to. The first course is rather good. I'm waiting to see how things happen with the next courses. I might take 1 or 2 courses for the November 2024-January 2025 terms.</p>

                <h3>Web Development Learning with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a></h3> 
                <p>I am still studying through the <strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/">Web Design Certification</a></strong>. I'm currently learning the HTML forms section of this certification, and about to start building my first small project to progress through this certification.</p>
                <p>Additionnally, I will start coding small projects from the <strong><a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">Front-End Mentor</strong></a>. This platform proposes learning paths, as well as many front-end challenges which can be hereafter add to our portfolio. I will definitely give it a try!</p>

                <h3>Dedicating my full time in learning Web development? That is the question...</h3> 
                <p>A few weeks ago, I lost my job as a remote virtual assistant. As a result, my current economic situation has taken a difficult turn. On the other side, I wonder if this would not be the right time and opportunity to dediacate myself fully to learning Web development, and initiate at last the professional reconversion I have been longing for. I have noticed that I was starting getting bored with my last job. I feel that the IT and Web development are the professional area that truly fascinate me. Maybe the time has come for me to dedicate myself in learning and practising Web development skills on a full-time basis, and little by little starting to advertise my services as a freelance Web developer.</p>

                <h3>Studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science</h3>
                <p>Three days ago, I started studying with the <a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/">University of the People</a> to earn a <strong><a href="https://www.uopeople.edu/programs/online-bachelors/computer-science/">Bachelor of Computer Science</a></strong> (fully online). I received a scholarship to study for free (or nearly so), at least up to the completion of the Associate Degree of Computer Science, which correspond to the first half of the Bachelor of Computer Science. I feel so excited at the prospect of going back to college and study for the professional area in which I would like to work in the future. I will keep on learning Web development on the FreeCodeCamp platform at the same time.</p>

                <h3>Starting afresh...</h3>
                <p>After many upheavals in both my professional and personal life, I have been able to resume my Web development learning. I decided to resume my learning. I had already studied and practiced some very basic skills, such as HTML and CSS. I had even started to learn a little bit of JavaScript. I have decided to start afresh pand to revise all these basic skills and concepts</p>

                <h3>My goals</h3> 
                <p>What are my goals in learning Web development, starting with Front-End development? Why do I want to become a Web developer?</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>A new professional career full of variety:</li>
                        <p>I want to embrace an interesting professional career, in which I don't want to feel bored. I don't want to feel like I'm doing the same things and fulfill the same tasks over and over again, on a daily basis. I crave for more variety in my professional life!</p>
                    <li>A challenge:</li> 
                        <p>I want to be challenged on a more regular basis, and indeed learn and use more difficult skills</p>
                    <li>Financial freedom</li>
                        <p>After many years living in difficult conditions, I crave for a better life. A successful professional career as a Web developer may well pave the way to a much more comfortable financial situation both for myself and my child (I am a single mother)</p>
                    <li>More flexibilty in my work life</li>
                        <p>I am looking for a professional career that would allow me to work on more flexible terms and schedules, and to reach a better work/family life balance.</p>
                </ul>

                <h3>My expectations on learning Web Development</h3> 
                <p>I think learning Web Development will be a very fascinating, thought-provoking and challenging journey. After many years spent studying English literature at university, I expect that learning Web Development will prove rather challenging</p> 
                <p>As I'm embarking into a learning journey into a field that I don't know much about, I expect to often feel very uncomfortable and pushed to my limits, and maybe a bit beyond. I expect that I will need to fight against my tendency to procrastinate and become easily discouraged. I will definitely need to find strategies to fight off these unfortunate tendencies.</p> 
                <p>On the other hand, should I successfully persevere in this learning experience, I'm sure it will awaken a lot of creativity and ability to think a bit more outside of the box.</p>
